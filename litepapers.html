        <h1 class="main-title">Overview</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Since 2014, stablecoins have proven themselves as the ideal mechanism
          for transferring value without exposing users to the price volatility
          of free-floating cryptocurrencies. Yet despite processing trillions in
          transaction volume and generating billions in revenue, the current
          stablecoin infrastructure operates on a fundamentally broken economic
          model that extracts value from users rather than sharing it with them.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Traditional stablecoins like Tether and USDC retain all revenues for
          their shareholders while providing users nothing beyond basic
          stability. When you hold $1000 in USDC, Circle earns yield on your
          capital while you receive zero participation in the value your
          deposits create. When stablecoin prices deviate and arbitrage
          opportunities emerge, whitelisted arbitrageurs capture these profits
          while users absorb the risk.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Even existing yield-bearing stablecoins fail to address this
          fundamental value extraction problem. While they redistribute small
          portions of underlying yields to users through permissioned
          mechanisms, they fail to solve the critical issue of mercenary
          liquidity, where users continuously chase higher returns elsewhere
          without building sustainable ecosystem value.
        </p>

        <h1 class="main-title">Introduction</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND is the world's first DeFi yield stablecoin combining the trust
          of full USDC backing with automated deployment across proven DeFi
          yield strategies, allowing users to maintain dollar-pegged stability
          while earning passive returns from a diversified portfolio of premium
          stable yield opportunities.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Built on the Base blockchain, BOUND operates through a fully on-chain
          infrastructure where underlying collateral is automatically allocated
          across multiple yield-generating protocols. Rather than manually
          managing positions across different DeFi platforms, users simply hold
          BOUND tokens to gain exposure to a professionally curated basket of
          stable yield strategies. The protocol transforms users from passive
          customers into active stakeholders by sharing both the underlying
          yield returns and protocol-generated revenue.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND's core innovation lies in its Atomic Peg Stability System, which
          maintains the token's dollar peg while capturing additional revenue
          streams. When BOUND's market price deviates from $1.00, the system
          automatically executes stabilization trades that generate arbitrage
          profits. These profits, traditionally captured by specialized
          whitelisted entities, are retained within the protocol and distributed
          to the community, creating an additional yield layer beyond the
          underlying DeFi strategies, offering one of the most competitive APYs
          in the stable yield market.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The BOUND protocol creates powerful incentives for sustained community
          engagement through ownership participation and competitive APY derived
          from diversified exposure across leading stable yield protocols and
          profits generated by the protocol infrastructure, establishing robust
          foundations for sustainable growth and decentralized governance that
          rewards commitment rather than temporary yield farming incentives.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">BOUND Token</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND is a native decentralized, collateral-backed digital asset
          designed to provide users with consistent value preservation. The
          token serves as a strong, stable value token pegged to $1 USDC,
          functioning as a reliable borrowing asset and productive collateral
          solution across the DeFi ecosystem. BOUND is fully backed by USDC
          reserves and tokenized Stable DeFi yield strategies. This backing
          structure establishes a robust foundation for stable value maintenance
          against inflation and reliable collateral performance within
          decentralized finance markets.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Utility and Access Mechanism</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          To gain exposure to the yield generated on the protocol's collateral
          reserve, users must first acquire BOUND and exchange it for BOUND+,
          the protocol's yield-bearing asset. BOUND+ reflects the protocol's
          earnings in real-time, with holders automatically receiving their
          proportional share through progressive token value appreciation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Each conversion between BOUND and BOUND+ is subject to a protocol fee
          of 58.67 basis points, calculated on the transaction value. This fee
          is payable in BOUND and is permanently burned, reducing the total
          supply of BOUND and thereby increasing the collateral surplus, which
          directly enhances the APY delivered to BOUND+ holders.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Users may opt to pay this access fee in BOUND Zero, the protocol's
          governance token, to receive a 25% fee reduction. To do so, a
          sufficient balance of BOUND Zero must be present in the user's wallet
          at the time of the transaction. The BOUND token is pegged to $1 USDC
          and is designed to provide stable, reliable access to protocol
          features. It is not intended as a speculative asset, but rather as a
          mechanism to facilitate protocol participation and align incentives
          with long-term value creation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Token Characteristics</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND operates as a stable value token engineered to maintain price
          stability through sophisticated backing mechanisms and automated
          market operations while enabling users access to yield farming
          opportunities across the broader DeFi landscape. In the BOUND
          ecosystem, the BOUND token serves as a stable-value access token whose
          core function is to serve as the sole medium of exchange to BOUND+,
          the yield-bearing asset of the BOUND protocol.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Market Access and Trading</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND is accessible to retail market participants through the official
          BOUND/USDC trading pair on Uniswap. Users can acquire BOUND tokens by
          exchanging USDC at an approximate 1 USDC per BOUND, providing
          straightforward access to the token's stable value proposition.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Collateral Backing System</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND is a fully collateralized stable value token where every token
          is backed by exactly $1 worth of verifiable on-chain assets. The
          strength of BOUND lies in its sophisticated collateral system that
          combines immediate collateral liquidity with productive yield
          generation, ensuring both price stability and long-term value growth.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The collateral backing BOUND consists of two complementary asset types
          that work together to maintain system stability while increasing
          collateral value over time. The collateral is divided between liquid
          USDC stored in the Liquidity Buffer reserve and illiquid collateral
          represented by tokenized shares of the Avantgarde DeFi Yield Vault
          stored in the Shares reserve. The liquid collateral serves as
          immediate liquidity for peg arbitrage mechanism operations. For
          example, when BOUND trades below $1, the protocol uses USDC from the
          Liquidity Buffer Reserve to purchase BOUND tokens from the market and
          burn them, reducing supply until the price returns to 1 USDC per
          BOUND. The second component of the reserve represents the illiquid
          collateral, which consists of tokenized shares of the Avantgarde DeFi
          Yield Vault stored in the Shares reserve.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Avantgarde DeFi Yield Vault</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Avantgarde Vault represents an institutional-grade, on-chain fund
          designed to optimize returns while maintaining capital preservation as
          its primary mandate. This sophisticated yield generation engine
          employs meticulously selected conservative strategies that focus
          exclusively on yield-bearing stablecoins, ensuring the underlying
          collateral maintains its stability while generating consistent
          returns.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The fund's strategic approach eliminates downside risk to BOUND's
          collateral base by investing only in assets that cannot depreciate
          below their face value. Through careful selection of proven DeFi yield
          opportunities within the stablecoin ecosystem, the Avantgarde Vault
          creates a secure environment where capital preservation and yield
          generation operate together effectively.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As the vault executes its yield strategies, the accumulated returns
          directly enhance the value of each vault share, creating organic
          growth in the total collateral backing BOUND tokens. This appreciation
          mechanism ensures that the collateral value grows beyond the initial
          $1 backing per BOUND token, generating surplus value that strengthens
          the entire protocol while providing additional benefits to users
          through the yield distribution system.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Avantgarde Vault operates as a fully transparent, on-chain fund
          where all investment decisions, performance metrics, and yield
          generation can be independently verified, establishing a new standard
          for institutional-grade DeFi treasury management.

          Protocol-Managed Liquidity Infrastructure
        </h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The BOUND Protocol incorporates an automated liquidity deployment
          system specifically designed to establish the BOUND/USDC official pool
          and secure reliable market access for BOUND tokens. This
          infrastructure provides comprehensive protection for users against
          several common DeFi risks that can compromise trading security and
          market integrity. The automated deployment system addresses critical
          market vulnerabilities through multiple protection mechanisms such as:
        </p>

        <div class="bullet-point">
          Fraud Prevention: Eliminates risks associated with unauthorized or
          malicious pool creation by ensuring the protocol deploys the official
          trading pool.
        </div>
        <div class="bullet-point">
          Liquidity Trap Mitigation: Ensures adequate initial liquidity to
          prevent market manipulation schemes that exploit low-liquidity
          environments.
        </div>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Market Launch and Liquidity Deployment</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The BOUND Protocol establishes market liquidity through a systematic
          deployment process designed to ensure stable market conditions from
          launch. The protocol initiates the BOUND/USDC pool by transferring $1
          million USDC from the company wallet to the Liquidity Pool Deployer
          contract. Upon receiving these funds, the contract triggers the
          Minting Engine to create an equivalent 1 million BOUND tokens,
          establishing the target launch price of $1.00 per token.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The protocol pairs these assets to create the official Uniswap
          liquidity pool, with the resulting LP tokens locked within the
          protocol treasury. This mechanism prevents liquidity removal that
          could destabilize the market while ensuring no pre-minted BOUND supply
          exists prior to pool creation. At launch, the pool becomes active with
          1 million BOUND tokens providing trading liquidity and 1 million LP
          tokens secured under protocol control.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This deployment architecture delivers robust liquidity infrastructure
          with professional-grade security measures and transparent operational
          procedures, protecting user interests while maintaining market
          integrity throughout the token's market introduction.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Atomic Peg Stability System (APSS)</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND becomes the first protocol to implement an automated system that
          democratizes arbitrage profits traditionally captured by whitelisted
          arbitrageurs and returns them directly to users. APSS represents a
          sophisticated stabilization system engineered to maintain the BOUND at
          a constant value of 1 USDC per BOUND. This mechanism operates directly
          within the official BOUND/USDC pool on Uniswap, where all retail
          trading activity occurs.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The system functions as a decentralized mechanism that responds in
          real-time to market conditions. It enforces both upside and downside
          price constraints, ensuring BOUND maintains a fixed exchange rate of 1
          BOUND per 1 USDC regardless of market pressures. The mechanism
          operates through active supply management, dynamically adjusting BOUND
          token circulation based on market demand and trading activity. When
          market forces push the price away from the $1 peg, the system
          automatically intervenes by minting new tokens or burning existing
          supply to restore equilibrium.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This stabilization mechanism is connected directly to the BOUND smart
          contract minting engine, enabling autonomous token supply adjustments
          in response to real-time market fluctuations. The architecture ensures
          consistent price stability while delivering capital efficiency for the
          BOUND protocol.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The automated supply management maintains market equilibrium by
          expanding token supply during periods of excess demand and contracting
          supply during selling pressure. This ensures BOUND consistently trades
          at its target peg regardless of trading volume or market volatility.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Unlike traditional stablecoin arbitrage mechanisms that rely on
          external arbitrageurs to identify and capture price dislocations, the
          BOUND protocol eliminates arbitrage delays and execution risks through
          automated intervention. While other protocols depend on whitelisted
          users or market participants to manually execute mint/redeem arbitrage
          when price deviations occur, BOUND's integrated system captures these
          arbitrage opportunities directly within the protocol, immediately
          converting arbitrage profits into additional collateral backing. This
          automated approach ensures faster price correction, eliminates
          reliance on third-party arbitrageurs, and allows the protocol to
          retain arbitrage value rather than distributing it to external
          participants.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Private Market Access â€“ Direct Minting</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          To support institutional demand and high-volume capital flows, the
          BOUND Protocol incorporates a dedicated Private Minting pathway for
          accredited and approved investors. This mechanism allows sophisticated
          investors to mint BOUND tokens directly through the protocol's minting
          contract, bypassing public liquidity pools and eliminating slippage
          that affects large transactions. The Private Minting Pathway addresses
          institutional requirements for capital-efficient token acquisition.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          While retail investors purchase BOUND through the Uniswap pool,
          institutional participants access a direct minting mechanism that
          avoids market price impact and AMM inefficiencies. This ensures
          large-scale investors receive exactly the amount of BOUND tokens
          corresponding to their USDC deposit. The Private Minting process
          operates through a streamlined institutional workflow. Investors
          supply USDC to the BOUND Minting Contract, which mints BOUND tokens at
          a 1:1 ratio. The protocol automatically allocates the received USDC
          directly to the Avantgarde Yield Fund, where the newly minted
          Avantgarde tokenized shares become part of the collateral backing
          system. Access to direct deposits into the Avantgarde yield fund
          remains strictly controlled, with only the protocol's smart contracts
          authorized to manage deposits and withdrawals.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This dual-access approach demonstrates BOUND's scalability and
          professional infrastructure. By providing retail access through
          Uniswap and institutional access through direct minting, the protocol
          accommodates diverse user needs while maintaining full collateral
          backing and decentralization principles across all acquisition
          methods.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">BOUND+ Token</h2>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Overview</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND+ represents the yield-bearing asset of the BOUND protocol,
          providing users with direct exposure to underlying yields generated
          through the protocol's reserve deployment and infrastructure revenue.
          The token functions as a yield-bearing instrument that captures and
          distributes value created through systematic DeFi strategy deployment
          and automated peg arbitrage operations. BOUND+ operates through a
          straightforward exchange mechanism with BOUND tokens. Users exchange
          BOUND for BOUND+ tokens initially at 1:1, with BOUND+ value
          subsequently reflecting the protocol's earnings from underlying yield
          generation and protocol-generated revenue streams.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The protocol generates revenue through two primary components:
          tokenized DeFi yield strategies deployed through the Avantgarde DeFi
          Yield Vault, and arbitrage profits generated through the automated peg
          stability mechanism that maintains BOUND's stable value using USDC
          reserves from the Liquidity Buffer.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When these revenue streams generate returns above baseline
          requirements, BOUND+ tokens appreciate in BOUND-denominated terms.
          This appreciation allows users to exchange their BOUND+ tokens back to
          BOUND and receive more tokens than initially deposited, directly
          capturing the value created through systematic yield generation and
          peg arbitrage operations. Unlike traditional yield-bearing tokens that
          rely on reward distribution mechanisms, BOUND+ captures value through
          mathematical precision, providing verifiable access to underlying
          yields through direct token appreciation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">BOUND+ Conversion Protocol</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          To access BOUND+ and gain exposure to protocol yield generation, users
          must pay an exchange fee of 0.5867% (58.67 basis points) calculated on
          the BOUND token value being converted. The protocol exchange fee
          ensures sustainable operation while providing the exclusive gateway to
          access BOUND+ yield exposure. Upon collection, fees paid in BOUND
          tokens are automatically burned, creating additional
          overcollateralization that enhances the protocol's competitive APY.
          Users who choose to pay protocol exchange fees directly in BOUND Zero
          tokens instead of BOUND receive a 25% fee reduction, lowering the
          effective cost to 44 basis points of the transaction value. To utilize
          this option during BOUND-to-BOUND+ exchanges, users must maintain a
          sufficient BOUND Zero balance in their wallet to cover the protocol
          fee amount.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Settlement Mechanism</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The exchange mechanism operates in real-time, with BOUND+ value
          calculated continuously based on the protocol's yield generation.
          Users can initiate exchanges between BOUND and BOUND+ tokens at any
          time at the current market rate, with a 7-day settlement period before
          the exchanged tokens become claimable. When exchanging BOUND to
          BOUND+, users submit their BOUND tokens and the exchange is executed
          immediately at the current BOUND+ rate. The resulting BOUND+ tokens
          are locked for 7 days before becoming claimable and transferable.
          Similarly, when exchanging BOUND+ back to BOUND, the conversion occurs
          immediately at the current rate, but the resulting BOUND tokens
          require a 7-day waiting period before they can be claimed. This
          settlement delay enhances protocol security by providing a buffer
          period that prevents rapid arbitrage exploitation and protects against
          potential flash loan attacks. During the waiting period, users
          maintain their claim to the exchanged tokens but cannot access or
          transfer them until the settlement period completes.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Market Access and Trading</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND+ is accessible to protocol participants exclusively through the
          exchange mechanism within the protocol's smart contract system. Users
          cannot acquire BOUND+ tokens directly through external markets or
          exchanges, ensuring that all tokens are properly backed by reserves
          and maintain integrity of the yield calculation system.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The exchange process requires users to first acquire BOUND tokens
          through standard protocol minting or market purchase, then submit
          these tokens to the protocol's exchange contract along with the
          required exchange fee. The system immediately calculates in real-time
          how many BOUND+ tokens the user will receive based on the current
          yield ratio, which represents the BOUND+ value compared to BOUND at
          that moment.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Dynamic Yield Calculation</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The protocol continuously measures yield generation through a
          sophisticated formula that captures revenue generated through DeFi
          strategy deployment and peg arbitrage operations. This calculation
          compares the current value of yield-generating assets to their initial
          deployment value, capturing appreciation that flows directly into the
          BOUND+ valuation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The yield calculation measures the performance of reserves deployed in
          yield-generating positions and peg arbitrage revenue. When
          yield-generating positions appreciate from their initial value, this
          appreciation flows directly into the BOUND+ token value, providing
          holders with exposure to the protocol's underlying revenue streams.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Security Framework</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND+ token value reflects the performance of underlying
          yield-generating strategies. The protocol deploys reserves across
          carefully selected DeFi strategies designed to preserve capital while
          generating returns. While the protocol cannot guarantee specific
          performance outcomes, the underlying strategies are structured to
          maintain value stability with upside potential from yield generation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The BOUND+ token system operates through comprehensive smart contract
          architecture that manages yield tracking, mathematical calculation
          execution, and token exchange operations. The yield calculation
          formula is implemented directly in smart contract code to ensure
          consistent and verifiable execution.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Reserve positions are tracked through on-chain balance verification
          for DeFi positions and trusted oracle feeds for asset valuations.
          Exchange operations include security measures such as slippage
          protection, maximum transaction limits, and multi-signature approval
          requirements for protocol parameter changes. All governance operations
          require multi-signature approval with time-delayed execution to
          provide transparency and community oversight.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Innovation in Decentralized Finance</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND+ token represents a breakthrough innovation in decentralized
          finance through the successful tokenization of protocol yield
          generation. By providing direct mathematical exposure to underlying
          revenue generated through systematic asset management, BOUND+ creates
          a transparent and verifiable method for capturing protocol-level value
          creation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Through its focus on stable yield generation across DeFi protocols and
          as the first project to implement automated peg arbitrage with profit
          distribution to users, BOUND+ offers institutional-grade exposure to
          underlying yields within a fully transparent and mathematically
          precise framework. The token establishes a new standard for
          yield-bearing instruments in decentralized finance.

        <h2 class="section-title">BOUND ZERO Token</h2>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Overview</h3>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <strong
            >A governance asset tied to protocol performance and user
            ownership</strong
          >
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The BOUND ZERO is the native governance and utility token of the
          protocol, designed to redistribute power and ownership to the
          community that helps build and support the protocol. It gives users
          direct control over the protocol, and the authority over how that
          value is managed and distributed.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO follows a disinflationary emission model, where new tokens
          are minted based on the protocol's real operational income. Emissions
          are not arbitrary, they are governed by smart contracts that enforce a
          strict link between protocol revenue and token creation. Every BOUND
          ZERO token in circulation reflects earned economic value, not
          speculative inflation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Utility and Market Positioning</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO serves as the protocol's native utility token, providing
          users with immediate cost savings for protocol access. The token's
          primary utility creates direct economic value for holders through
          reduced transaction costs and improved protocol economics.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The most significant utility feature is the 25% fee reduction on
          protocol access. Users who pay exchange fees directly in BOUND ZERO
          tokens instead of BOUND receive this substantial discount, lowering
          the effective cost from 58.67 basis points to 44 basis points of the
          transaction value. This creates immediate and measurable value for
          BOUND ZERO holders on every exchange transaction.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Beyond fee reduction, BOUND ZERO holders gain access to enhanced
          reward multipliers when locking BOUND+ tokens. Users who lock BOUND
          ZERO alongside their BOUND+ positions can achieve up to maximum
          multiplier benefits, significantly increasing their BOUND ZERO earning
          potential. This dual-token locking mechanism creates sustained demand
          for BOUND ZERO while rewarding long-term protocol participation.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The token also provides exclusive governance rights, granting holders
          direct control over protocol parameters including fee structures,
          revenue allocation decisions, and emergency protocol actions. This
          governance utility ensures that BOUND ZERO holders maintain influence
          over the protocol's economic policies and strategic direction.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO's utility-driven design creates a sustainable demand model
          where users acquire tokens not for speculative purposes, but for
          tangible economic benefits including fee savings, enhanced rewards,
          and governance participation. This positions BOUND ZERO as an
          essential component for active protocol participants seeking to
          optimize their interactions and influence within the BOUND ecosystem.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Emissions Tied to Real Yield</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO operates under a revenue-backed emission model, where new
          tokens are minted in proportion to the protocol's actual income. This
          establishes a direct correlation between token creation volume and the
          revenue inflow in the protocol treasury.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This structure ensures that BOUND ZERO emissions are always capped by
          actual protocol revenue rather than arbitrary token inflation. New
          tokens are created proportionally to protocol income, with a minimum
          baseline emission that ensures continuity during periods of low or no
          revenue, creating a sustainable supply framework tied to performance.
        </p>

        <div class="note-box">
          <strong>Note:</strong><br />
          To ensure continuity and protect the system during periods of low or
          no revenue, the protocol includes a minimum emission parameter
          (R_min). This parameter guarantees a baseline level of BOUND ZERO
          rewards, preventing total reward depletion and maintaining a minimum
          APY for participants. It is designed to preserve protocol stability
          and keep staking incentives active even under adverse market
          conditions.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">How BOUND ZERO is Earned</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO is distributed as rewards to users who lock BOUND+, the
          yield bearing asset received when exchanging BOUND tokens. By locking
          BOUND+ tokens, users contribute to the protocol's long-term capital
          stability and begin earning BOUND ZERO rewards on a daily basis.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Penalty Fees</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          All locking and reward distribution mechanisms are executed on-chain
          through audited smart contracts, ensuring full transparency and
          automatic enforcement of terms. Users who commit to a fixed lock
          duration begin receiving BOUND ZERO rewards on a daily basis for the
          entire period, with rewards being fully claimable and transferable as
          they accrue.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          However, early unlocks are subject to a strict penalty model. If a
          user decides to exit their lock before the agreed period ends, they
          are required to pay a penalty fee equal to the total amount of BOUND
          ZERO they would have earned had they completed the full lock duration.
          This includes both claimed and unclaimed rewards. The penalty must be
          settled in BOUND ZERO at the time of exit. This mechanism is designed
          to reinforce long-term participation, prevent abuse of the reward
          system, and maintain alignment between individual incentives and the
          overall economic health of the protocol.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Bound Governance Power</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          BOUND ZERO also functions as the exclusive governance token of the
          BOUND Protocol. Holding BOUND ZERO grants users the right to
          participate in protocol decision-making, with direct influence over
          how treasury funds are allocated and how core system parameters evolve
          over time. Governance is conducted entirely on-chain, and all votes

          strategic direction.

        <h3 class="subsection-title">
          Adaptive Supply Cap and Revenue-Gated Issuance
        </h3>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The total maximum supply of BOUND ZERO is capped at 10 billion tokens,
          but this does not mean that all 10 billion tokens will necessarily
          enter circulation. Unlike traditional token models, where the full
          supply is pre-allocated or scheduled to be released over time
          regardless of usage or demand, BOUND ZERO uses a revenue-gated
          issuance model. In this system, tokens are only minted when the
          protocol generates actual income. That income must first pass through
          an on-chain allocation mechanism, which determines how much of it can
          be used to issue new BOUND ZERO tokens.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Even more importantly, the community of BOUND ZERO holders governs the
          emission logic. Through on-chain voting, the DAO can choose to reduce
          or completely halt token issuance regardless of the unused supply
          remaining in the emission pool. For instance, if the market price of
          BOUND ZERO is underperforming, or if the circulating supply is
          considered too high, the community may vote to allocate 100% of
          protocol revenue to token burns rather than continuing to mint and
          distribute new BOUND ZERO.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As a result, large portions of the 10 billion cap may remain
          permanently unminted, effectively reducing the long-term total supply.
          This introduces an adaptive supply ceiling that responds to market and
          governance conditions while preserving the protocol's economic
          sustainability. In essence, the 10 billion token cap is a hard upper
          limit, not a supply target and the actual circulating supply may be
          significantly lower, based entirely on real usage, governance
          decisions, and protocol performance.
